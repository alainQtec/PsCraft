  Sometimes I just want something to work and not to have think about it.

</br>
</br>
To focus on writing code and not get bogged down in intricacies of
the build process.

<p>

<p>
This module aims to eliminate the need to <b>write and test build scripts</b>
The only code you are expected to write is in <a href="/Public/">Public</a> functions and <a href="Tests">Tests</a>.

ðŸ˜” Tests have to be written by humans. There's just no other way.

> rest.
